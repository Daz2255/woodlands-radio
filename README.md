## Problem Domain

Woodlands Residential Nursing home is home to 34 residents that aged from 52 to 100. They would like to deploy a closed loop radio station in the home that residents can listen to through their TV’s.

They have the required hardware and radio play out system, but need help to display and play the radio station on the residents tv’s and to survey residents as to there favourite music genres and decades so that the automatic play out system can be programmed accordingly.

The home also has lots of musicians that visit the home and a regular basis. Not all residents are able to leave their rooms and they miss out on this entertainment.

The website will only initially be available in the home, but may in future be made available to the wider community.

They would like a webpage that plays the radio station on loading that would be displayed on the residents TV’s, and also act as the home page for the website.

They would like a page where past performances by musicians could be stored and played.

They would like to conduct the survey using audio as a prompt to help identify stlyes of music.

They would like the results of the survey displayed visually and in a table.
